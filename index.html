        <p class="u-text u-text-2">I have been encapsulated by IT all my life. At a young age my Grandfather gifted me his Xbox original with Halo 1. Video games sparked my interest into the world of Technology. Since then, video games were integral to my development as a person, they taught me: problem solving, teamwork, patience, competitiveness, communication, perseverance, time management and just how to enjoy myself. I chose RMIT because it is a world renown University, ranked top 2% worldwide while being located in Melbourne, a city with endless opportunity and diversity. I expect to hone and perfect my IT craft; become an efficient programmer, create connections to people and companies, learn how to lead and work in a team of similar minded individuals and grow as a member of society.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The tests
have a positive impact by highlighting your strengths and weaknesses, a
detailed explanation of where you would best fit in a team or workplace
environment. It is always good to be introspective and self-reflect so you can
take strides towards building upon your strengths while mitigating the loss
from your weaknesses.</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">Campaigners
are a mixture of Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Prospecting and Assertive. These
traits are essential in a team environment. Campaigners are the leaders of the
team, the people whom communicate and get ideas across. They can see if their
colleagues are experiencing something emotional or internal then take action to help
them.&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-4">The "Education Planner" dictates my learning style as visual and slightly auditory. &nbsp;I learn by reading or seeing pictures. I understand
and remember things by sight. To ensure I learn the fastest and efficiently I
should seek out information in visual form.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-5">Big Five
Personality describes me as open to experience, extraversion and aggregable.
This makes my personality ideal for the Technology Industry. A large issue
inside the industry is the difficulty to get ideas across. Extraverted personalities like
working with others and enjoy direct leadership roles. Good leaders require a
mix of communication skills, openness to new ideas, understanding other’s
perspectives, technical problem solving and being conceptually creative. All traits linked
to the Campaigner.</p>

        <p class="u-text u-text-6">Campaigner
is an essential role when forming a team. There should be a mixture of
different personalities to ensure a diverse range of opinions and ideas. Although
it is good to form a group upon personality strengths, all this should be taken
with a grain of salt as there are varying factors that determine a cohesive
team, not all of which can be determined through an online quiz.</p>

will be an isometric tower defense game called Gods Vs Titans. The aim of the
game is to defend your base from the encroaching Titans by building powerful
Gods and synergising them with their respective demi-gods. The game will include
a campaign that can be played solo or with friends. Gods Vs Titans is a complex
and challenging game, pulling mechanics from the recently popular Dota auto
chess/ Team fight Tactics and Bloons Tower Defense 6.</p>

order to get a foothold into the gaming industry I must build up my portfolio.</p>
